	Author: 		Michael Needham Oct 2012, blog.7thdomain.com/2012/09/03/auto-archive-script-for-outlook-mac-2011/ (feedback/suggestions welcome)
	
	Details:
	 			Mail:
				-----
				- Script to auto archive a full folder structure from the default (or nominated) exchange account to local 'on my computer' root folder
	 			- Set parameteres in 'Global Settings' section below, before running script
				- Script can be run manually from AppleScript Editor which is useful if you want to review the debug event log (click twice on the "Events" button above the logging window to see log output), however...
				- It's also recommended you schedule the script from Outlook's 'Run Schedule' tool to execute on a regular basis (daily recommended)
				
				Calendar:
				---------
				- Script also archives calendar events from the nominated exchange account to local 'on my computer' archive calendar
	 			- Set parameteres in global settings section below before running script 


				- Calendar and mail archiving can be separately enabled with different archive periods

	-- Global Settings which you can change if required ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	-- General	
	set exchangeAccountDescription to "<exchange account>" -- By default you don't have to change this to your account name as the script will attempt to auto detect the primary account. However, if you have multiple accounts then you set this to the greyed out name of your Exchange Account in the main Outlook window holding all your folders (Inbox etc)
	set runInSimulationMode to false -- when set to true no mail or calendar events will be archived. It will however create the appropriate folder structures under 'On My Computer' and the candidate items that will be archived will be logged to the events window for you to review. The script can be run repeatedly to test out the effect off different parameters below. You can also optionally delete the empty folders that were created from running in this mode if you want to re-run the simulation
	set minutesBeforeTimeOut to 3 -- When first running this script against a very large mailbox (one user had 150 000 mails in one folder to archive, for example), it can take the script a long time to build the arrays necessary for calculating the items to be archived. By default AppleScript will timeout quite quickly if it feels an application is taking too long to respond. This timeout value overrides that to allow it handle the long processing times. You can make it longer if you still experience timeouts (CPU dependent).  In extreme large cases an alterntive is to manually drag down mail to your archive and then allow the script to keep the archive up to date from there.
	set processingDelay to 0.2 -- The number of milliseconds to wait between moving messages on Outlook. On slower machines Outlook can't handle the speed at which the script requests mail to be moved sometimes causing a lock-up. It also makes Outlook more responsive while running in the background. 
	set doNotArchiveCategoryName to "Do Not Archive" -- If you create an Outlook category that has this exact name (case sensitive) and assign that category to messages or calendar events the archiving process will skip those items indefinitely
	
	
	-- Mail Archive parameters
	set archiveMailItems to true -- no mail archiving will take place if set to false
	set daysBeforeMailArchive to 80 -- number of days to keep mail in your exchange account before archiving
	set localMailArchiveRootFolderName to "Archive Mail" -- name of the root archive mail folder to create under 'On My Computer'. If an existing archive mail folder is found it will use it, otherwise it will create the folder for you
	set excludedMailFoldersList to {"Subscribed Public Folders", "Junk E-mail", "Deleted Items", "Sync Issues", "quarantine", "Conversation History"} -- list of mail folders in your exchange account to exclude (sub-folders will also be excluded).
	set processSubFoldersofExcludedFolders to false -- By setting to true subfolders will be archived even though the parent folder is excluded for all excluded folders in above list (e.g. excluding your inbox but allowing it's sub-folders to be archived). Note that in this mode, folders with the repeated same name in your folder tree hierarchy will be all excluded if included in the excluded list.
	set doNotArchiveInCompleteTodoItems to false -- If set to true then archiving will ignore all items that are marked with a todo flag but are not complete (including items with no due date which are by definition always incomplete)
	
	
	
	-- Calendar Archive parameters
	set archiveCalendarItems to true -- no calendar archiving will take place if set to false
	set localArchiveCalendarName to "Archive Calendar" -- name of the archive calendar to create under 'On My Computer'. If an existing calendar is found it will use it, otherwise it will create the calendar for you
	set daysBeforeCalendarArchive to 730 -- number of days to keep non-recurring calendar events in your exchange account before archiving
	set archiveReccuringEvents to false -- If you wish to also archive recurring events then set this to true. Warning: if a recurring event is moved to the archive it will remove the entire series from your calendar even if those recurrances are present today
